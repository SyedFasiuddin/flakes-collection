This repository contains my collection of flakes and their lock files,
currently no organization for these files are planned and hence they will
be dumped here in root.

To start a new project with flake, just copy the `.nix` and `.lock` file
for the type of project and get going, keep `.lock` files in here is my
choice, it might be unnecessay (only time will tell) and if it proves to
be then I'll remove all lock files.
